There were these three guys that all worked together at a construction site.  1 was an Italian, 1 was a Pollock, and the other was an Englishman.  One day, they were all sitting down eating lunch when the Italian suddenly jumped up and exclaimed,"If I have another meatball sandwich for lunch then I will jump off this building!  I hate meatball sandwiches!!"  The Englishman suddenly stood up and said,"If I have another corned beef sandwich for lunch, then I will jump off with you!!"  Then the Pollock said,"If I have another Kielbasa sandwich for lunch, then I will jump with you guys."

The next day came along and it was time for lunch.  The Italian opened his lunch box and found a meatball sandwich so he jumped off the building.  The Englishman was next.  He opened his lunch and found a corned beef sandwich so he jumped off the building.  Then the Pollock found a Kielbasa sandwich for lunch so he jumped off the building too!!!

At their funeral the following day, the 3 widows were all talking.  The Italian's widow told the other 2 women..."If only I had known that he didn't like meatball sandwiches!!  He would still be alive today!!"  "Me too!" said the Englishman's wife.  "I had no idea that he didn't like corned beef!!"  Then the Pollock's wife said,"Don't look at me!!  He packed his own lunch!!!"

A philosopher, a mathematician and an idiot died. They were met by the devil. "I`m sorry fellows but heaven is full at the moment and there is only 1 vacancy available." says the devil. "So each of you is given a chance to ask me a question and if I can answer correctly then you go to hell but if I fail then you go to heaven." They all agreed. 

The philosoher wanted to go first. "What is the most comprehensive text on philosopy by Socrates?"

The devil snapped his finger and a book appeared. He gave it to the philosopher. He read it and agreed that the devil was right. "Then go to hell" says the devil and snaps his fingers.

The mathematician was next and he asked the devil for the most difficult Math formula. Once again the devil snapped his fingers and a book appeared. The guy reads the formular and reluctantly agrees with the devil. The devil once again snaps his fingers and this guy too goes to hell.

Now comes the idiot. He asks the devil for a chair. The devil brings him one. He then asks the devil to drill holes on the chair to which the devil obliges. He then sat on the chair and farted. He now asks the devil,"Which hole did my fart come out from?"

The devil replies that it was the 3rd hole on the right.

"Wrong" replied the idiot."

"It was my asshole."

The idiot got to go to heaven.

A mouse and a lion walk into a bar, and they're sitting there chugging away at a few ales when a giraffe walks in. "Get a load of her," says the mouse, "I fancy that!" 

"Well, why not try your luck?" says the lion.

So the mouse goes over to the giraffe and starts talking to her.   Within five minutes they're out the door and gone into the night. 

The next day, the lion is in the bar and the mouse staggers in.  The mouse is absolutely ragged, worn out, ruined. The lion helps his pal up onto a stool, pours a drink down his throat and asks, "What the hell happened to you? I saw you leave with the giraffe.  What happened after that? Was she all right?"

The mouse says, "Yeah, she was really something else! She invited me back to her place to spend the night."

"But how come you look like you're so exhausted?" asks the lion.

"Well", says the mouse, "Between the kissing and the screwing, I must have run a thousand miles!"

Miss Bea was in her 80's and much admired for her sweetness and kindness to all.  The pastor came to call on her one afternoon early in the Spring and she welcomed him into her Victorian parlor.  She invited him to have a seat while she prepared a little tea.

As he sat facing her old pump organ, the minister noticed a cut glass bowl sitting on top of it, filled with water.  In the water floated, of all things, a condom.  Imagine his shock and surprise.  Imagine his curiosity; surely Miss Bea had flipped!  But he certainly couldn't mention the strange sight in her parlor.

When she returned with tea and cookies they began to chat.  The pastor tried to stifle his curiosity about the bowl and its strange floater, but soon it got the best of him, and he could resist no longer.  "Miss Bea," he said, "I wonder if your would tell me about this," pointing to the bowl.

"Oh, yes," she replied, "Isn't it wonderful!  I was walking downtown last fall and I found this little package.  It said to put on your organ and keep it wet, and it would prevent disease.  And you know, I think it is working; I haven't had a cold all winter.

Subject:  Girlfriend Software 

I'm currently running the latest version of GirlFriend and I've been having some problems lately.  I've been running the same version of DrinkingBuddies 1.0 forever as my primary application, and all the GirlFriend releases I've tried have always conflicted with it.  I hear that DrinkingBuddies won't crash if GirlFriend is run in background mode and the sound is turned off. But I'm embarrassed to say I can't find the switch to turn the sound off. I just run them separately, and it works okay. Girlfriend also seems to have a problem co-existing with my Golf program, often trying to abort Golf with some sort of timing incompatibility. 

I probably should have stayed with GirlFriend 1.0, but I thought I might see better performance from GirlFriend 2.0. After months of conflicts and other problems, I consulted a friend who has had experience with GirlFriend 2.0.  He said I probably didn't have enough cache to run GirlFriend 2.0, and eventually it would require a Token Ring to run properly.  He was right - as soon as I purged my cache, it uninstalled itself. 

Shortly after that, I installed GirlFriend 3.0 beta.  All the bugs were supposed to be gone, but the first time I used it, it gave me a virus anyway.  I had to clean out my whole system and shut down for a while. 

I very cautiously upgraded to GirlFriend 4.0.  This time I used a SCSI probe first and also installed a virus protection program.  It worked okay for a while until I discovered that GirlFriend 1.0 was still in my system.  I tried running GirlFriend 1.0 again with GirlFriend 4.0 still installed, but GirlFriend 4.0 has a feature I didn't know about that automatically senses the presence of any other version of GirlFriend and communicates with it in some way, which results in the immediate removal of both versions. 

The version I have now works pretty well, but there are still some problems.  Like all versions of GirlFriend, it is written in some obscure language I can't understand, much less reprogram. Frankly I think there is too much attention paid to the look and feel rather than the desired functionality. Also, to get the best connections with your hardware, you usually have to use gold-plated contacts.  And I've never liked how GirlFriend is totally "object-oriented." 

A year ago, a friend of mine upgraded his version of GirlFriend to GirlFriendPlus 1.0, which is a Terminate and Stay Resident version of GirlFriend.  He discovered that GirlFriendPlus 1.0 expires within a year if you don't upgrade to Fiancee 1.0.  So he did, but soon after that, he had to upgrade to Wife 1.0, which he describes as a huge resource hog. It has taken up all his space, so he can't load anything else. One of the primary reasons he decided to go with Wife 1.0 was because it came bundled with FreeSexPlus. 

Well, it turns out the resource allocation module of Wife 1.0 sometimes prohibits access to FreeSexPlus, particularly the new Plug-Ins he wanted to try.  On top of that, Wife 1.0 must be running on a well warmed-up system before he can do anything.  Although he did not ask for it, Wife 1.0 came with MotherInLaw which has an automatic pop-up feature he can't turn off. 

I told him to try installing Mistress 1.0, but he said he heard if you try to run it without first uninstalling Wife 1.0, Wife 1.0 will delete MSMoney files before doing the uninstall itself.  Then Mistress 1.0 won't install anyway because of insufficient resources.

The Perfect Story

There was a perfect man who met a perfect woman.  After a perfect courtship, they had a perfect wedding.  Their life together was, of course, perfect.

One snowy, stormy Christmas Eve this perfect couple was driving a perfect car (a Ferrari) along a winding road when they noticed someone at the roadside in distress. Being the perfect couple, they stopped to help. There stood Santa Claus with a huge bundle of toys.  Not wanting to disappoint any children on the eve of Christmas, the perfect couple loaded Santa and his toys into their vehicle.  Soon they were driving along delivering the toys.  Unfortunately, the driving conditions deteriorated and the perfect couple and Santa Claus had an accident.

Only one of them survived the accident. Who was the survivor?




The perfect woman. She's the only one that really existed in the first place. Everyone knows there is no Santa Claus and there is no such thing as a perfect man.

*  A Male's Response  *  (Page Down )

So, if there is no perfect man and no Santa Claus, the perfect woman must have been driving. This explains why there was a car accident in the first place.

"Doc, you've gotta help me... my wife just isn't interested in sex anymore.  Haven't you got a pill or something I can give her?"

"Look, I can't prescribe..."

"Doc, we've been friends for years.  Have you ever seen me this upset? I am desperate!  I can't think; I can't concentrate; my life is  going utterly to Hell!  You've got to help me."

The doctor opens his desk drawer and removes a small bottle of pills.  "Ordinarily, I wouldn't do this.  These are experimental, the tests so far indicate that they're VERY powerful. Don't give her more than ONE, understand?  JUST one."

"I don't know, doc; she's awfully cold..."

"One.  No more.  In her coffee.  Okay?"

"Um... okay."

Our hero expresses gratitude, and departs for home, where his wife has dinner waiting.  When dinner is finished, she goes to the kitchen to bring dessert.  Our hero, in fumbling haste, pulls the pills from his pocket and drops one into his wife's coffee.  He reflects for a moment, hesitates, then drops in a second pill.  And then he begins to worry.  The doctor did say they were powerful. Then an inspiration strikes: he drops one pill into his own coffee.

His wife returns with the shortcake, and they enjoy their dessert and coffee, our hero with poorly concealed anticipation.Sure enough, a few minutes after they finish, his wife shudders a little, sighs deeply and heavily, and a strange smoky look enters her eyes. In a deep, throaty, near-whisper, in a tone of voice he has never heard her use before, she says, "I... need... a man..."

His eyes glitter and his hands tremble as he replies, "Me... too.."

She asked him a question the next week too,
"Joe, who was in the holy family?"
and once again the kid behind joe stuck him in the ass with a pencil, Joe jumped up and yelled out
"Jesus, Mary, and Joseph!"
and the teacher was dumbfounded again.
Then the next week she thought of the hardest question she could.
"Joe, what did Eve say to Adam after they had their 30th child?"
This time joe was only pretending to sleep, he jumped up turned around and yelled out,
"IF YOU STICK THAT GODDAMED THING IN ME ONE MORE TIME ILL KILL YOU!"

A young couple got married._ On their honeymoon, they were very anxious to consummate the marriage because they were both virgins._ They had saved themselves for the right partner and for marriage._ Because of their sexual inexperience, they were a bit uncomfortable discussing the  subject, so they came up with the term "doing the laundry" to use in  place of "making love" or "having sex."_ This made them both more comfortable with the whole concept. Well, the first night of their honeymoon was wonderful._ They both had many years of pent up sexual frustration to expend so they "did the laundry" no less than five times that first night and finally fell asleep together completely exhausted._ In the middle of the night, the new husband woke up and he was ready to do the laundry again._ He gently shook his new wife and asked her, "Can we do the laundry again?" but she was very tired and all of this new activity had taken its toll on her body._ She told him that she just couldn't do it again just yet-maybe in the morning. A few hours later, the new wife awoke feeling very guilty._ Her new husband had saved himself for her for many years and she decided she should go ahead and "do the laundry" with him again. She gently shook him and said, "Honey, I'm sorry I denied you...we can do the laundry again if you want" and he replied, "That's okay...it was a small load so I did it by hand."

There was a city boy who had just moved into the country. He went walking around to check out his suroundings and found a farmer selling chickens. The city boy went over to the farmer to see how much he was selling them for. 

The farmer asked him if he wanted a male or a female. The city boy asked for both. So the farmer said, "Here you go, one cock and one pull-it." The city boy confused asked him what he meant. The farmer said, "A cock is a male chicken and a pull-it is a female chicken." The city boy said, "Oh." and went on his way with two chickens one under each arm. 

A bit further down the road he saw a donkey for sale. He went to the man who was selling it to find out how much it was. The man said, "The ass is 15 dollars." The city boy replied, "No, I wan't the donkey out side in your yard." The man just said, "That's an ass." The city boy, new to these terms, just said, "Oh." and bought the donkey.

As he was leaving the man yelled out, "Wait, the ass gets a bit stubborn about going over hills, so you have to scratch him behind the ears to get him going again." So the city boy is going back home and the donkey stops dead in its tracks and he can't get it to move. He can't scratch its ear because he would have to drop one of the chickens and it would run away. So the city boy starts to fuss and yell at the donkey. While he is doing this a beautiful women walks up and asks him if he needs help.

The city boy thinks, hey why don't I try to impress this beautiful women by using my new slang terms that I learned today. So the city boy turns to the woman and says, "Yeah, could you hold my cock and pull-it while I scratch my ass?"

A general store owner hires a young female clerk with a penchant for very short skirts. One day a young man enters the store, glances at the clerk, and glances at the loaves of bread behind the counter.

"I`d like some raisin bread, please," the man says politely.

The clerk nods and climbs up a ladder to reach the raisin bread, located on the very top shelf. The man, standing almost directly beneath her, is provided with an excellent view. As the clerk retrieves the bread, a small group of male customers gather around the young man, looking in the same direction.

Pretty soon each person is asking for raisin bread, just to see the clerk climb up and down.

After a few trips the clerk is tired and irritated. She stops and fumes at the top of the ladder, glaring at the men standing below. She notices an elderly man standing amongst the throng. "Is yours raisin too?" the clerk yells testily.

"No," croaks the feeble old man....

"But it`s startin` to twitch."

She is concerned that the old fellow could overexert himself. After the festivities she  prepares herself for bed and for the knock on the door she is expecting.

Sure enough the knock comes and there is her groom ready for action. They unite in conjugal union and all goes well whereupon he takes his leave of her and she prepares to go to sleep for the night.

After a few minutes there's a knock on the door and there the old guy is again ready. Somewhat surprised she consents to further coupling which is again successful after which the octogenarian bids her a fond good night and leaves.

She is certainly ready for slumber at this point and is close to sleep for the second  time when there is another knock at the door and there he is again fresh as a 25 year old and ready for more.

Once again they do the horizontal boogie. As they're laying in afterglow  the young woman says to him, "I am really impressed that a guy your age has enough juice to go  for it three times. I've been with guys less than half your age who were only good  for one."

Optical Illusion 

A man and his wife had been stranded on a deserted island for many years. The morning following a bad storm, a new guy washes up on the shore. 

The new guy and the wife are VERY attracted to each other right away, but they realize that certain protocols will have to be observed. The husband, oblivious to the pheremones floating around, is just glad to have someone new to talk to. 

"This is wonderful! Now we'll be able to have three people doing 8-hour shifts in the watchtower instead of two people doing 12-hour shifts." 

The new man is only too happy to help, and in fact volunteers to do the first shift. He climbs up the tall tower and stands watch, scanning the ocean horizon for any ships. Soon the husband and wife start placing stones in a circle in order to make a fire to cook supper. The new man yells down: "Hey, no screwing!" They look at each other and yell back: "We're not screwing!" 

A few minutes later, they start to put driftwood into the stone circle. Again the new man yells down: "Heeey, no screwing!" Again they yell back, "We're not screwing!" 

Later they are putting palm leaves on the roof of the shack to patch leaks. Once again the new man yells down from high above: "Hey, I said no screwing!!" They yell back, "And we said we're not screwing!!" 

Finally the shift is over and the new man climbs down from the tower and the husband starts to climb up. By the time he gets half-way up, his wife and the new man are already screwing their brains out. 

Once at the top, the husband turns around and looks down and says to himself: "Son-of-a-gun. From up here it DOES look like they're screwing."

Joe's wife was sick. Very sick. None of the doctors could figure out what was wrong with her. He was about to go into her room and visit her when her doctor approached him. The doctor said: "These might be her last few days, so you should do whatever she asks of you, so that she may die happy." 

Well... Joe thought this over and decided that that was a great idea. He went in and they talked for about 3 hours. After awhile he asked her if there was anything that he could do for her. She thought for a little bit and said, "Make love to me. Eat my pussy.... Fuck me like you never have before..."  He thought this was a little much in her condition, but since It might be one of the last times he sees her he decided to comply.

The next day he came in, and her doctor said that she was much better, and he should do whatever he did yesterday. Well.. he walked in and they talked, and she requested they make passionate love again, and again he complied.

After about 5 days of this she had fully recovered, and was able to go home. She walked into the living room to find that Joe was crying. She said, "What's the matter? I'm fine now.

There's this guy who's in the market for a used motorcycle. Always wanted a nice big hog. So he's shopping around, answering ads in the newspaper, and not having much luck. One day he comes across a beautiful classic Harley with a for sale" sign on it. Upon inspection, he is amazed to find the bike in mint condition. He inquires about it with the owner: 

"This bike is beautiful! I'll take it. But you gotta tell me how you keep it in such good shape. "Well," says the seller, "it's pretty simple. Just make sure that if the bike is outside and it's going to rain, rub Vaseline on the chrome. It protects it from the rain. In fact, since you're buying the bike I won't need my tube of Vaseline anymore. Here, you can have it." and he hands the buyer a tube of Vaseline. 

So the guy buys the bike and off he goes, a happy biker. He takes the bike over to show his girlfriend. She's ecstatic (being a Harley fan). 

That night, he decides to ride the bike over to his girlfriend's parents' house. It's the first time he's going to meet them and figures it will make a big impression. When the couple gets to the house, the girlfriend grabs her boyfriend's arm. 

"Honey," she says, "I gotta tell you something about my parents before we go in. When we eat dinner, we don't talk. In fact, the person who says anything during dinner has to do the dishes." 

"No problem," he says. And in they go. 

The boyfriend is astounded. Right smack in the middle of the living room is a huge stack of dirty dishes. In the family room, another huge stack of dishes. Piled up the stairs, dirty dishes. In fact, everywhere he looks, dirty dishes. They sit down to dinner and, sure enough, no one says a word. 

As dinner progresses, the boyfriend decides to take advantage of the situation. So he leans over and kisses his girlfriend. No one says a word. So he decides to reach over and fondle her breasts. He looks at her parents, but still they keep quiet. 

So he stands up, grabs his girlfriend, strips her naked, and they make love right on the dinner table. Still, no one says a word. 

"Her Mom's kinda cute", he thinks. So he grabs his girlfriend's Mom and has his way with her right there on the dinner table. Again, total silence. 

Then, a few raindrops hit the window and the boyfriend realizes it's starting to rain. He figures he'd better take care of the motorcycle, so he pulls the Vaseline from his pocket. Suddenly the father stands up and shouts: "All right, all right! I'll do the damn dishes."

"No Pastor, we were not able to go without sex for the two weeks," the young man replied sadly. 
"What Happened?" inquired the pastor.  
"My wife was reaching for a can of corn on the top shelf and dropped it. When she bent over to pick it up, I was overcome with lust and took advantage of her right there." 
"You understand, of course, this means you will not be welcome in our church," stated the pastor. 
"We Know." said the young man, "We're not welcome at Krogers anymore either."

Two whales, a male and female, are swimming off the coast of Japan when the male sees the whaling ship that killed his father.

Excited at the opportunity to avenge his father's death, the male whale says to the female "Let's go underneath the ship and blow air through our blow holes. That ought to knock their boat over, and make them think twice about killing innocent whales."<br

The female whale agrees, and the plan works perfectly. Once the ship has sunk, the male whale notices sailors making their way back to shore by either swimming or in lifeboats.

Not willing to let them get away so easily, the male whale yells, "They're going to shore - Let's go gobble them up!" 

The female whale becomes less cooperative. She says, "I agreed to the blow job, but there is NO WAY I'm swallowing seamen!"

Kevin, a 19 year old college student, is home for summer break. In order to make a few extra bucks he decides that he is going to apply for a part time job at the local K-Mart. Kevin fills out the standard application and is called into the manager's office. The manager is the typical K-Mart employee-skinny, glasses, pocket protector and K-Mart clothes. Also, he takes a little too much pride in working at K-Mart. He says, "Kevin, do you think you have what it takes to work at the 'Big K'?"
Kevin laughs to himself, thinking "what an asshole !" But since it was an interview he responded, "Absolutely." 
The Manager continued, "In order to work here you need to be a salesman and you need to be in touch with the customer. Do you think you've got those qualities?" 
Again, Kevin laughs to himself, "Is this fucking guy serious?" but he says again, "Absolutely."
"Well, let me show you how it's done,"says the manager. The manager leads Kevin to a counter and waits for a customer. The first guy to come along drops a 50 pound bag of grass seed on the counter. The manager says, "That's a pretty big bag of grass seed ya got there." 
"Yup," responds the customer. The manager winks at Kevin and says, "Ya think you might need a new lawn mower for all that grass you're putting down?" Kevin actually sees the lightbulb go off over the customer's head. 
"Yeah! That's a great idea." 
The manager leads him back to the lawn mowers and helps him pick out a really nice model. 
"Ya see, Kev, that's how it's done. Ya think you can do that?" 
"Oh yeah!" says Kevin, "Just watch." Kevin steps up to the counter and the next man to come along drops a huge package of tampons onto the counter. 
Kevin looks at the box and then at the embarrassed customer. "That's a pretty big box of tampons ya got there," says Kevin. The embarrassed man looks up feebly and says, "Yup." 
A moment of silence passes and then Kevin blurts out, "Would you be interested in buying a new lawnmower?" 
The customer looks up from his shoes and responds, "What would I want a lawnmower for?"
Kevin winks at his customer and says, "Well, since you won't be getting laid this weekend I figured you might want to move your lawn!"

A man was sitting in the bar when he noticed another patron a few stools away. the guy had a body like Charles Atlas, but his head was the size of a thimble. The first man said "please excuse me for staring, but I cant help but be curious as to why your body is so well developed, but your head is so small?" The man said "buy me a drink and I’ll tell you." the drink was ordered and the story began. 
"I was in the navy and my ship was sunk by a torpedo.  I was the only survivor and I managed to make it to a deserted island a few miles away.  I had been there alone for several months and was sitting on the beach one day waiting for a bird or fish to come by so I would have something to eat, looking up I saw a beautiful mermaid sunning on a nearby rock. she swam over to me and informed me that she was a magical mermaid and could grant me three wishes. Great I said. I’d like to be rescued.  She slapped the water with her tail and a ship appeared, sailing straight for my island. Next I asked for a body like Charles Atlas.  Another slap of the tail and here it is.  Then, noticing how beautiful she was and all my other wishes fulfilled I asked if I could make love to her.  She said no it just wouldnt work her being half fish and all.  
So I said well, how about a little head then?

Did you hear about the postman who was surprised one morning on his rounds when the lady of the house invited him in? She served him a delicious breakfast, and then invited him into the bedroom. He was puzzled, but went along out of curiosity. She asked if he wanted to go to bed with her, and so he did that too.  But when he realized it was time to finish his rounds, he had to  leave. The housewife insisted on giving him a dollar before he could go. 
This was too much for the poor man, and he asked her:  “Lady, what is going on? First you feed me a delicious breakfast, and as if that isn't enough, you invite me to make love to you and we have a terrific time together. And now you want to pay me?!  What IS this, anyway?" So she explained proudly: "Well, you know Christmas is coming, and I told my husband I wanted to do something nice for the postman, who is so faithful about delivering our mail all year. 
My husband said, 'Fuck the postman! Give him a dollar!'...But the breakfast was my idea!"

A woman and her husband had been married for a while & she realized one day that their sex life wasn't going well at all. The woman decided to go to the doctor's office & ask him what he thought that she should do. The doctor gave her a bottle of hormone pills and told her to give them to her husband twice a day--one in the morning & one at night. She went home & did what he had said. That night, they did the nasty--their first in 6 months. The next day, the woman thought, 'I wonder if sex will be better if he took more'. A week later, the son was sitting on the couch watching TV when the phone rang. It was the doctor.
The doctor asked, "So, how are your mom's hormone pills coming?" The son then responded, "Well, sir, I dont know what the hell you're talking about, but all I know is that my mom's dead, my sister's pregnant, my ass hurts & my dad's outside going, 'Here Kitty, Kitty, Kitty!!'"

A man has been in jail for ten years and his sentence is up, so they let him out.  They give him some clothes and a five dollar bill on his way out.  As soon as the man gets out, he walks straight to a whorehouse, slaps some money on the table in the entrance, and yells, "I wanna eat pussy!"  The woman looks at the five dollars, and shakes her head saying, "I don't know if you've ever done business here before, but five dollars doesn't get you much."  The man ignores her and yells again, "I wanna eat pussy!"  The man is very big and the woman in front doesn't want any trouble to start so she takes him to the back, and there's a whore lying down on a bed with her legs spread out.  The man goes right ahead and starts going down on her.  While he's eating her, he notices a funny taste in his mouth, like scrambled eggs or something.  He thought that was kind of strange, but continued.  Then he started tasting something like salad.  He thought that was funny because he hadn't had any salad in weeks.  Then he tasted something like prime rib.  The man had been in jail for the past ten years and he sure as hell knew he hadn't been eating any prime rib lately, so he looks up at the whore and says, "Excuse me, I think I'm going to be sick."  The whore looks down at him and says, "Really, that's exactly what the last guy said!"

Little while later another woman, this time a fantastic lookin redhead, comes walkin by in front of them...

She explained that this was an example of poetry, but could be changed to prose by changing the last line from "the lamb was sure to go" to "the lamb went with her."

A few days later she asked for an example of poetry or prose.  Johnny raised his hand and recited,  "Mary had a little pig, an ornery little runt, he stuck his nose in Mary's clothes, and smelled her little--"

There was this businessman who was getting ready to go on a long business trip. He knew his wife was a flirtatious sort, so he thought he'd try to get her something to keep her occupied while he was gone, because he didn't much like the idea of her screwing someone else. 

So he went to a store that sold sex toys and started looking around. He thought about a life-sized sex doll but that was too close to another man for him. He was browsing through the dildos, looking for something special to please his wife, and started talking to the old man behind the counter. He explained his situation. The old man said, "Well, I don't really know of anything that will do the trick. We have vibrating dildos, special attachments, and so on, but I don't know of anything that will keep her occupied for weeks, except -- " and he stopped. 

"Except what?" the man asked. 

"Nothing, nothing." 

"C'mon, tell me! I need something!" 

"Well, sir, I don't usually mention this, but there is the 'voodoo dick.' " 

"So what's up with this voodoo dick?" he asked. 

The old man reached under the counter, and pulled out an old wooden box, carved with strange symbols. He opened it, and there lay a very ordinary - looking dildo. 

The businessman laughed, and said "Big fucking deal. It looks like every other dildo in this shop!" 

The old man replied, "But you haven't seen what it'll do yet." He pointed to a door and said "Voodoo dick, the door." The voodoo dick rose out of its box, darted over to the door, and started screwing the keyhole. The whole door shook with the vibrations, and a crack developed down the middle. Before the door could split, the old man said "Voodoo dick, get back in your box!" The voodoo dick stopped, floated back to the box and lay there, quiescent once more. 

"I'll take it!" said the businessman. 

The old man resisted, saying it wasn't for sale, but he finally surrendered to $700 in cash. The guy took it home to his wife, told her it was a special dildo and that to use it, all she had to do was say "Voodoo dick, my pussy." 

He left for his trip satisfied that things would be fine while he was gone. 

After he'd been gone a few days, the wife was unbearably horny. She thought of several people who would willingly satisfy her, but then she remembered the voodoo dick. She got it out, and said "Voodoo dick, my pussy!" The voodoo dick shot to her crotch and started pumping. It was great, like nothing she'd ever experienced before. After three orgasms, she decided she'd had enough, and tried to pull it out, but it was stuck in her, still thrusting. She tried and tried to get it out, but nothing worked. Her husband had forgot to tell her how to shut it off. So she decided to go to the hospital to see if they could help. She put her clothes on, got in the car and started to drive to the hospital, quivering with every thrust of the dildo. 

On the way, another orgasm nearly made her swerve off the road, and she was pulled over by a policeman. He asked for her license, and then asked how much she'd had to drink. Gasping and twitching, she explained that she hadn't been drinking, but that a voodoo dick was stuck in her pussy, and wouldn't stop screwing. 

The officer looked at her for a second, and then said "Yeah, right. Voodoo dick, my ass!"

The next day he bundled his young bride off to the doctor, and as expected, the doctor prescribed a very powerful antibiotic with instuctions to take the medication for two weeks. After five days the wife was feeling much better so they started the usual 5:10 to 5:30 workday ritual in the bedroom. 

After seven more days the antibiotics had almost completed their work. There were only three germs left in the wife's body. These three germs were discussing how they were going to survive the antibiotic attack. 

The first germ said, "I'm doing to hide behind her left earlobe. The antibiotics would never think of looking for me behind that earlobe so I will survive." 

The second said, "I going to go to the center of her back. That way I will see from which direction the antibiotics are coming from and run the other way. If I'm fast enough, I'll out run them and survive." 

The third germ said, "You can go hide behind her left earlobe and you can try and out run them on her back, but I think the antibiotics will get you no matter what you do. I know that I will survive because tonight when the 5:25 pulls out, I'm going to be on it!

BEFORE VIAGRA

A rancher told the vet that he had a bull that wasn't mating with the other cows.  The vet told the rancher to stick his hand up the cows pussy and rub whatever got on his hand on the bull's nose.  He went home and did just that.  The next day, the bull was screwing everything he came in contact with.  The rancher thought, "Hmmm, my sex life hasn't been that great lately.  Maybe I'll try it, too."  So that night, after his wife is asleep, he sticks his hand up her pussy and wipes what comes out all over his nose.  Then he wakes his wife up and turns the light on, telling his wife to look.  She says, "You woke me up to show me a bloody nose?"

A man was visiting his wife in hospital where she has been in a coma for several years. On this visit he decided to rub her left breast instead of just talking to her. On doing this she let out a sigh. The man ran out and told the doctor who said that was a good sign and suggested he should try rubbing her right breast to see if there is any reaction.

The husband went in and rubbed her right breast. This produced a moan from his wife. He rushed out and told the doctor. The doctor said this was amazing and a real breakthrough. The doctor then suggested the man should go in and try oral sex, saying he would wait outside as it is a personal act and he didn't want the man to be embarrassed.

The man goes in, then came out about five minutes later, white as a sheet. He told the doctor his wife is dead.  The doctor asked what happened, to which the man replied, "She choked."

One dismal rainy night, a taxi driver spotted an arm waving from the  shadows of an alley halfway down the block. Even before he rolled to a stop at the curb, a figure leaped into the cab and slammed the door.  Checking his rear view mirror as he pulled away, he was startled to  see a dripping wet, naked woman sitting in the back seat.   "Where to?" he stammered.   
"Union Station," answered the woman.   
"You got it," he said, taking another long glance in the mirror.    
The woman caught him staring at her and asked, "Just what the hell are you looking at, driver?"   
"Well ma'am, I noticed that you're completely naked, and I was just wondering how you'll pay your fare."   
The woman spread her legs, put her feet up on the front seat, smiled  at the driver and said, "Does *THIS* answer your question?"   
Still looking in the mirror, the cabbie asked, "Got anything smaller?"

"New Weight Loss Plan"

Did you hear about the heavyset guy who had tried every diet in the world in an attempt to lose weight? He tried the Scarsdale diet, the Navy diet, Weight Watchers, and many more.  None worked. Then, one day, he was reading the Washington Post when he noticed a small ad that read: Lose weight Only $1.00 a pound Call (202) 555-0238.

The man decided to give it a try and called the number. A voice on the other end asked, "How much weight do you want to lose?" The man responded, "Ten pounds. "The voice replied, "Very well, give me your credit card number and we'll have a representative over to your house in the morning."

About 9:00 am the next morning the man gets a knock on the door. There stood a beautiful redhead, completely naked except for a sign around her neck stating, "If you catch me, you can have me." Well, the hefty fellow chased her upstairs, downstairs, over sofas, through the kitchen, all around the house. Finally, panting and wheezing like a dog, he did catch her. When he was through enjoying himself, she said, "Quick, go into the bathroom and weigh yourself." He did just that and was amazed to find that he had lost ten pounds, right to the ounce!

That evening he called the number again. The voice on the other end asked, "How much weight do you want to lose?" To which the somewhat-less-overweight man replied, "Ten more pounds." "Very well," the voice on the phone told him, "Give me your credit card number and we'll have a representative over to your house in the morning. 

"At about 8:00 am the next morning the man receives a knock on the door. When he opens the door he sees a beautiful blonde dressed only in track shoes and a sign around her neck stating, "If you catch me, you can have me." The chase took a good while longer this time and the man nearly passed out, but he finally did catch her.

When he was through she told him, "Quick, run into the bathroom and weigh yourself." He ran to the bathroom and found he had lost another 10 pounds! "This is fantastic!" he thought to himself. Later that evening he called the number again and the voice at the other end asked, "How much weight do you want to lose?" "Fifty pounds!" the man exclaimed.

"Fifty pounds?" the voice asked, "That's an awful lot of weight to lose at one time." The man replied, "Listen buddy, here's my credit card number, you just have your representative over here in the morning!" and he hung up the phone.

About 6:00 am the next morning the man gets out of bed, splashes on some cologne and gets all ready for the next representative. At about 7:00 am he gets a knock on the door. When he opens the door, he sees this huge gorilla with a sign around his neck stating, "If I catch you, I am going to have you."

51 DAYS
 
A bartender is sitting behind the bar on a typical day, when the door bursts open and in come four exuberant blondes. They come up to th bar, order five bottles of champagne and ten glasses, take their order over and sit down at a large table.  The corks are popped, the glasses are filled and  they  begin toasting and chanting, "51 days, 51 days, 51 days!"  Soon, three more blondes arrive, take up their drinks and the  chanting grows. "51 days, 51 days, 51 days!" Two more blondes show up and soon  their voices are joined in raising the roof. "51 days, 51 days, 51 days!"  Finally, the tenth blonde comes in with a picture under her arm.  She walks over to the table, sets the picture in the middle and the table  erupts. Up jumps the others, they begin dancing around the table, exchanging  high-fives, all the while chanting "51 days, 51 days, 51 days!"
 
The bartender can't contain his curiosity any longer, so he walks over to the table.  There in the center is a beautifully framed child's puzzle of the Cookie Monster.  When the frenzy dies down a little bit, the  bartender asks one of the blondes, "What's all the chanting and celebration about?

The blonde who brought in the picture pipes in, "Everyone thinks that blondes are dumb and they make fun of us.  So, we decided to set the record  straight.  Ten of us got together, bought that puzzle and put it together. . .the side of the box said 2-4 years, but we put it together in 51 days ! "

There is this blonde that gets tired of people telling her all the blonde jokes so she dyes her hair brown. One day she is driving in the country and she sees a shepard with all his sheep, she stops and asks the shepard "If I can guess how many sheep you have will you give me one?" the Shepard thinks that she would never guess the right number so he says "Sure". So the blonde just says the first number that comes to mind "316!", and the Shepard is shocked and says  "wow, your right! okay pick your sheep" so the blonde looks at the sheep and picks the one she wants and puts it in her car. Than the Shepard Says "If I can guess your true hair color will you give me my dog back?"

"Car for sale"

A blonde tried to sell her old car, but was having problems getting rid of it because the vehicle had been driven 250,000 miles.

She discussed her problem with a brunette co-worker at the Salon Shop.  The brunette mentioned that she knows of a procedure to make the car easier to sell, but it's illegal to do so.
        
"That doesn't matter," replied the blonde, "if I can just sell the car."
        
"Okay," said the brunette. "Here is the address of a friend of mine who owns a car repair shop.  Tell him I sent you, and he will turn the counter in your car back to 50,000 miles.  Then you should be able to unload the car."
        
The following weekend, the blonde went to see the co-worker's mechanic to have the work done.
        
Several weeks went by before the brunette asked the blonde, "Did you sell your car?"
        
"No," replied the blonde, "why should I?  It only has 50,000 miles on it."

This is one for all of us computer users,who truly understand the magic of it all.

One of those "Dear Jen" letters...

Dear Jenny,

Ann Landers wouldn't print this. I have nowhere else to turn. I have to get the word out.  Warn other parents. I must be rambling on. Let me try and explain.

It's about my son, Billy. He's always been a good, normal ten-year-old boy. Well, last spring we sat down after dinner to select a summer camp for Billy. We sorted through the camp brochures. There were the usual camps with swimming, canoeing, games, singing by the campfire, you know. There were sports camps and specialty camps for weight reduction, music, military camps and camps that specialized in Tibetan knot tying. We tried to talk him into Camp Winnepoopoo. It's where he went last year.  (He made an adorable picture out of painted pinto beans and macaroni).  Billy would have none of it. Billy pulled a brochure out of  his pocket. It was for a COMPUTER CAMP! We should have put our foot down right there, if only we had known. He left three weeks ago. I don't know what's happened. He's changed. I can't explain it. See for yourself.

These are some of my little Billy's letters.

Dear Mom,
The kids are dorky nerds. The food stinks. The computers are the only
good part.  We're learning how to program. Late at night is the best
time to program, so they let us stay up.
    Love, Billy.
**
Dear Mom,
Camp is O.K. Last night we had pizza in the middle of the night. We
all get to choose what we want to drink. I drink Classic Coke. By the
way, can you make Szechuan food? I'm getting used to it now. Gotta go,
it's time for the flowchart class.
    Love, Billy.
P.S. This is written on a word processor. Pretty swell, huh? It's spell
checked,  two.
**
Dear Mom,
Don't worry. We do regular camp stuff. We told ghost stories by the
glow of the green computer screens. It was real neat.  I don't have much
of a tan 'cause we don't go outside very often. You can't see the
computer screen in the sunlight anyway. That wimp camp I went to last
year fed us weird food too. Lay off, Mom. I'm okay, really.
   Love, Billy.
**
Dear Mom,
I'm fine. I'm sleeping enough. I'm eating enough.  This is the best
camp ever. We scared the counselor with some phony worm code. It was
real funny.   He got mad and yelled. Frederick says it's okay. Can you send
more money?  I spent mine on a pocket protector and a box of blank
diskettes.   I've got to chip in on the phone bill.  Did you know that
you can talk to people on a computer? Give my regards to Dad.
   Love, Billy.
**

Dear Mother,
Forget the money for the telephone. We've got a way to not pay.
Sorry I haven't written. I've been learning a lot. I'm real good at
getting onto any computer in the country. It's really easy! I got into
the university's in less than fifteen minutes. Frederick did it in five,
he's going to show me how.  Frederick is my bunk partner. He's really
smart. He says that I shouldn't call myself Billy anymore. So, I'm not.
   Signed, Bill.
**
Dear Mother,
How nice of you to come up on Parents Day. Why'd you get so upset? I
haven't gained that much weight. The glasses aren't real. Everybody
wears them. I was trying to fit in. Believe me, the tape on them is
cool. I thought that you'd be proud of my program. After all, I've made
some money on it. A publisher is sending a check for $30,000.  Anyway,
I've paid for the next six weeks of camp. I won't be home until late
August.
   Regards, Bill.
**
Mother,
Stop treating me like a child. True... physically I am only ten years
old.  It was silly of you to try to kidnap me. Do not try again.
Remember, I can make your life miserable (i.e. the bank, credit bureau,
and government computers). I am not kidding. O.K.?  I won't write again,
and this is your only warning. The emotions of this interpersonal
communication drain me.
   Sincerely, Bill.
****

See what I mean? It's been two weeks since I've heard from my little
boy.  What can I do, Jenny? I know that it's probably too late to save
my little Billy. But, if by printing these letters you can save JUST ONE
CHILD from a life of programming, please, I beg of you to do so.

Thank you very much,
Sally Gates, Concerned Parent

The boy said "I alread told you we don't sell half heads of lettuce." The man insisted on buying only a half head of lettuce. The boy said let me go check with my boss. When the boy got to the office he told the boss that there was some jerk that wanted to buy a half head of lettuce. When he turned around he saw that the man had followed him to the office. He then said And this man wants the other half. Is that OK with you? The boss said sure. 
Later the boss told the boy that he liked his quick thinking and said we need more of that around here. He then asked the boy where he was from. The boy said I am from Minnisota. His boss asked him why he moved. He told the boss that the only thing in Minnosota was hockey players and whores. The outraged boss said my wife is from Minnisota!!!!

WHAT DO ANGELS LOOK LIKE?

Like the little old lady who returned your wallet yesterday.

Like the taxi driver who told you that your eyes light up the world, when you smile.

Like the small child who showed you the wonder in simple things.

Like the poor man who offered to share his lunch with you.

Like the rich man who showed you that it really is all possible, if only you believe.

Like the stranger who just happened to come along, when you had lost your way.

Like the friend who touched your heart, when you didn't think you had one to touch.

Angels come in all sizes and shapes, all ages and skin types.

Some with freckles, some with dimples, some with wrinkles, some without.

They come disguised as friends, enemies, teachers, students, lovers and fools.

They don't take life too seriously, they travel light.

They leave no forwarding address, they ask nothing in return.

They wear sneakers with gossamer wings, they get a deal on dry cleaning.

They are hard to find when your eyes are closed,

But they are everywhere you look, when you choose to see.

An inspiring thought

A while back I was reading about an expert on subject of time management. One day this expert was speaking to a group of business students and, to drive home a point, used an illustration those students will never forget. As this man stood in front of the group of high-powered overachievers he said, "Okay, time for a quiz."

Then he pulled out a one-gallon, wide-mouthed mason jar and set it on a table in front of him. Then he produced about a dozen fist-sized rocks and carefully placed them, one at a time, into the jar. When the jar was filled to the top and no more rocks would fit inside, he asked, "Is this jar full?" Everyone in the class said, "Yes."

Then he said, "Really?" He reached under the table and pulled out a bucket of gravel. Then he dumped some gravel in and shook the jar causing pieces of gravel to work themselves down into the spaces between the big rocks. Then he asked the group once more, "Is the jar full?" By this time the class was onto him. "Probably not," one of them answered. "Good", he replied.

He reached under the table and brought out a bucket of sand. He started dumping the sand in and it went into all the spaces left between the rocks and the gravel. Once more he asked the question, "Is this jar full?". "No", the class shouted. Once again he said, "Good".

Then he grabbed a pitcher of water and began to pour it in until the jar was filled to the brim. Then he looked up at the class and asked, "What is the point of this illustration?" One eager beaver raised his hand and said, "The point is, no matter how full your schedule is, if you try really hard, you can always fit some more things into it". "No", the speaker replied, "that's not the point. The truth this illustration teaches us is: If you don't put the big rocks in first, you'll never get them in at all."

What are the 'big rocks' in your life?
A project that you want to accomplish?
Time with your loved ones?
Your faith, your education, your finances?
cause?
Teaching or mentoring others?
Remember to put these BIG ROCKS in first or you'll never get them in at all.

So, tonight or in the morning when you are reflecting on this short story, ask yourself this question: What are the 'big rocks' in my life or business? Then, put those in your jar first.

Don't get too caught up with life. Take time to smell the flowers along the way,,,,
Life is short. Enjoy while it lasts.....
________________________________________________________

One day a fisherman was lying on a beautiful beach, with his fishing pole propped up in the sand and his solitary line cast out into the sparkling blue surf. He was enjoying the warmth of the afternoon sun and the prospect of catching a fish. About that time, an investment banker came walking down the beach, trying to relieve some of the stress of her workday. She noticed the fisherman sitting on the beach and decided to find out why this fisherman was fishing instead of working harder to make a living for himself and his family. "You aren't going to catch many fish that way," said the investment banker to the fisherman.  "You should be working rather than lying on the beach".
The fisherman looked up at the investment banker, smiled and replied, "And what will my reward be?"
"Well, you can get bigger nets and catch more fish" was the banker's answer. "And then what will my reward be?" asked the fisherman, still smiling.
The investment banker replied, "You will make money and you'll be able to buy a boat, which will then result in larger catches of fish".
"And then what will my reward be?" asked the fisherman again.
The investment banker was beginning to get a little irritated with the fisherman's questions. "You can buy a bigger boat, and hire some people to work for you" she said.
"And then what will my reward be?" repeated the fisherman.
The investment banker was getting angry. "Don't you understand? You can build up a fleet of fishing boats, sail all over the world, and let all your employees catch fish for you".
Once again the fisherman asked, "And then what will my reward be?"
The investment banker was red with rage and shouted at the fisherman, "Don't you understand that you can become so rich that you will never have to work for your living again. You can spend all the rest of your days sitting on this beach, looking at the sunset. You won't have a care in the world."
The fisherman, still smiling, looked up and said, "And what do you think I'm doing right now?"

Five doctors went duck hunting one day. Included in the group were a general practice (GP) physcian, a pediatrician, a psychiatrist, a surgeon and a pathologist.  

After a time, a bird came winging overhead. The first to react was the GP who raised his shotgun, but then hesitated. "I'm not quite sure it's a duck," he said, "I think that I will have to get a second opinion."  And of course by that time, the bird was long gone.

Another bird appeared in the sky thereafter. This time, the pediatrician drew a bead on it. He too, however, was unsure if it was really a duck in his sights and besides, it might have babies.  "I'll have to do some more investigations," he muttered, as the creature made good its escape.

Next to spy a bird flying was the sharp-eyed psychiatrist. Shotgun shouldered, he was more certain of his intended prey's identity. "Now, I know it's a duck, but does it know it's a duck?" The fortunate bird disappeared while the fellow wrestled with this dilemma.

Finally, a fourth fowl sped past and this time the surgeon's weapon pointed skywards.  BOOM!!  The surgeon lowered his smoking gun and turned nonchalantly to the pathologist beside him.

"Go see if that was a duck, will you?"

The old feller replied, "Yep.  It comes from clean living.  Why I know I live a good, clean, spritual life." The doctor asked, "What makes you say that?" The old man replied, "If I didn't live a good, clean life the Lord wouldn't turn the bathroom light on for me every time I get up in the middle of the night."
The doc was concerned. "You mean when you get up in the night to go to the bathroom, the Lord Himself turns on the light for you?"
"Yep," the old man said,  "Whenever I get up to go to the bathroom, the Lord turns the light on for me."
Well, the doctor didn't say anything else, but when the old man's wife came in for her check up, he felt he had to let her know what her husband said.
"I just want you to know," the doctor said.  "Your husband's in fine physical shape but I'm worried about his mental condition   He told me that every night when he gets up to go to the bathroom, the Lord turns the light on for him."

"Medical Board"

Dr. Cook was brought up on charges at the medical board. He had, it seemed, uttered the vilest profanity to his nurse.

He explained, "Let me tell you what happened.  My alarm didn't go off, so I woke up late. When I did wake up, I tried to turn on the light in the lamp on my nightstand.  The bulb exploded and scared me for a minute, so I pulled the cord out of the wall, and the lamp fell over and broke.

Then I was trying to make a little breakfast when a whole army of little Girl Scouts showed up and tried to sell me tons of cookies.  I had to buy five boxes to get rid of the kids.  By then my coffee was ice cold, and my eggs were burned.  I gulped down a glass of juice.  It turned out to be sour.

When I started to drive to the office, the car conked out.  The alternator was gone.  I didn't have my auto club card with me so I had to pay to have the car towed to a service station.  I looked at my service book and discovered that the warranty ran out last week.

I took a cab to the office, but around Main Street somebody sideswiped us, and I hit my head on the door handle.  I finally made it into my office when my nurse said, "Doctor, a shipment of thermometers just came in.  What shall I do with them?"

"I've never been better!" he boasted. "I've got an eighteen year old bride who's pregnant and having my child! What do you think about that?" 
The doctor considered this for a moment, then said, "Let me tell  you a story. I knew a guy who was an avid hunter. He never missed a season.   But one day went out in a bit of a hurry and  he accidentally grabbed his umbrella instead of his gun." The doctor continued, "So he was in the woods and suddenly a grizzly bear appeared in front of him! He raised up his umbrella, pointed it at the bear and squeezed the handle."
"And do you know what happened?" the doctor  queried.
Dumbfounded, the old man replied "No."
The doctor continued, "The bear dropped dead in front of him!"
"That's impossible!" exclaimed the old man. "Someone else must have shot that bear."

Two boys are playing football in Golden Gate Park when one
is attacked by a rabid Rottweiler. Thinking quickly, the
other boy rips off a board of a nearby fence, wedges it down
the dog's collar and twists, breaking the dog's neck. A 
reporter who was strolling by sees the incident, and rushes
over to interview the boy.  The reporter starts writing 
"Young Forty Niners' Fan Saves Friend From Vicious Animal."
Then the boy replies, "I'm not a Forty Niners fan."
"Sorry, since we are in San Francisco I just assumed you
were," said the reporter and starts again. "Little Oakland
Raiders' Fan Rescues Friend From Horrific Attack" he continued
writing in his notebook. "I'm not a Raiders Fan either," 
said the boy.  "I assumed everyone in the Bay Area was 
either for the Niners or Raiders.  What team do you root 
for?" the reporter asked. 
"I'm a Cowboys fan."  The boy replied.
The reporter starts a new sheet in his notebook and writes,
"Little Redneck Bastard Kills Beloved Family Pet."

An engineer dies and reports to the pearly gates. St. Peter checks his dossier and says, "Ah, you're an engineer -- you're in the wrong place." So the engineer reports to the gates of hell and is let in. Pretty soon, the engineer gets dissatisfied with the level of comfort in hell, and starts designing and building improvements. After a while, they've got air conditioning and flush toilets and escalators, and the engineer is a pretty popular guy.

One day God calls Satan up on the telephone and says with a sneer, "So, how's it going down there in hell?" 

Satan replies, "Hey, things are going great. We've got air conditioning and flush toilets and escalators, and there's no telling what this engineer is going to come up with next."

God replies, "What??? You've got an engineer? That's a mistake -- he should never have gotten down there; send him up here." 

Satan says, "No way. I like having an engineer on the staff, and I'm keeping him." 

God replies "Send him back up here or I'll sue." 

Satan laughs uproariously and answers, "Yeah, right. And just where are YOU going to get a lawyer?"

A man walks into an antique store, and starts looking around. All of the sudden he spies a huge BRASS RAT in the corner.  He falls in love with it, and so he takes it to the cashier.
 
"The rat, eh?" says the old grizzly cashier
 
"um, yeah...how much?" replies our friend
 
"Well, five bucks for the rat--but 200 dollars for the story," he replied.
 
"I'll just take the rat, without the story." Says the customer.

He leaves the store, his precious brass rat tucked under his arm. Soon he begins to notice that a few rats are following him.  He walks a few more blocks and the number of rats behind him increased.  This continued, until there were virtually millions of rats behind him.

Afraid of this mass following the man ran to the sea and threw the rat in.  All of the rats plunged in after it, and met their watery deaths.
  
The man ran back to the antique store.  The old cashier was chuckling to himself.  "So now do you want the story?"
 
"No," said the man, "but have you got any brass lawyers?"

The priest said, "I don't mind sleeping with God's creatures, I will take the barn."
So they all agreed and went to their rooms(Barn).
About an hour later there was a knock at the guest room door and there stood the priest. "There is a chicken in there that won't stop clucking! I'm sorry but I'm going to have to sleep in the guest room."
"That's ok," said the farmer, "I'll sleep in the barn, after all, I'm used to it."
So they all agreed and traded places. About an hour later there was a knock at the guest room door and there stood the farmer. "I can't stand the odor from that cow in there any more. I'm sorry but I'm going to have to sleep in the guest room."

"Can you give me a one-pound lawyer's brain? Ever since I was a littlegirl I've dreamed of being a trial attorney."

                            BILL'S LAMENT

Every young man grows to be,
In search of his place in history,
Some grow up and grow old,
While others seize power and grow bold,

From a small town in the Ozarks,
Came a man who's johnson has a birthmark,
He learned quickly to take the cash,
No shame from him, they're made of brass,

He picked up a partner, almost an ivy leaguer,
Another shyster in the family, he probably need her,
They'd run a bed and breakfast, a quaint white house with a porch light,
And charge the party faithful 50 grand a night,

Then along came a man, a real shining Starr,
Looking into this thing called Whitewa-tar,
But Bill says he didn't do anything wrong,
As Hillary sang a chorus of the lost billing records song,

Then like a scene straight out of X-Files,
The records appeared, along with some sheepish smiles,
Hillary said she didn't know from whence they came,
She and Bill didn't care if it was lame,

They had a good laugh, and they were laughing at us,
The media said, it could happen, let's not make a fuss,
So Bill says, hey let's do it again,
Let's look at some files on republicans,

When they were found out they just blamed a lackey, there was hardly a stink,
They laughed again and poured another drink,
How many times will this work, they asked James Carville,
He said, go for the gusto, so what if we all burn in hell,

So they cleared out the travel office in a blink,
And once again the media said, nudge nudge, wink wink,
Then they slowed the pace for a while,
And the booming economy helped approval ratings spiral,

But Paula, she just wouldn't go away,
Let's go to court she was heard to say,
But Bill's denials were sounding like old hash,
So he got Carville to call her trailer trash,

So now comes rumors about a young intern,
Bill gave her private lessons, and she was quick to learn,
He denied it all, didn't happen, no no,
He's beginning to sound like the ancient greek philospher, Fellatio,

He doesn't understand why people get all bent,
He's not like us, he's the president,
He wasn't going to keep her, he was just samplin',
It's perks like that makes the job worth havin',

But he'll survive, that's the media buzz,
American's' pockets are full, they don't care what he does,
This is one political life that can't be killed,
An A-Bomb would destroy everything but cockroaches and Bill.

God was looking down on the earth and decided everything was too messed up to let it continue. He decided an ultimatum on humans would do the trick, so he called up who he thought were the three most important people on earth to tell them. God decided to call up Boris Yeltsin, Bill Clinton and Bill Gates.

God meets with them and tells them that unless they can make the world a perfect place in 3 days, he is going to kill everyone.

Boris Yeltsin goes back, and speaks to the Russian people. He says "I have bad news. There is a god, and he will kill us all in 3 days if we don't make the world perfect."

Bill Clinton goes back, and speaks to the American people. He says "I have good news and bad news. The good news is there is a god, but the bad news is that he will kill us all in 3 days unless we make the world perfect."

Bill Gates goes back, and speaks to all his Microsoft employees. He says, "I have good news. God thinks I am one of the 3 most important people on earth, and we don't have to worry about finishing Windows98."

"Don't Squat With Yer Spurs On, A Cowboy's Guide To Life"
by Texas Bix Bender


Never ask a man the size of his spread.

Never kick a fresh turd on a hot day.

After eating an entire bull, a mountain lion felt so good he started roaring.  He kept it up until a hunter came along and shot him.  The moral: when you're full of bull, keep your mouth shut.

If you find yourself in a hole the first thing to do is stop diggin'.

Never smack a man who's chewin' tobacco.

It don't take a genius to spot a goat in a flock of sheep.

When dealin' with a slick son of a bitch, start off by pinnin' him down and changin' his oil.

Never ask a barber if he thinks you need a haircut.

Never follow good whiskey with water, unless you're out of good whiskey.

If you get to thinkin' you're a person of some influence, try orderin' somebody else's dog around.

Don't worry about bitin' off more than you can chew.  Your mouth is probably a whole lot bigger'n you think.

Good judgement comes from experience, and a lot of that comes from bad judgement.

Always drink upstream from the herd.

Never drop your gun to hug a grizzly.

If you're ridin' ahead of the herd, take a look back every now and then to make sure it's still there.

When you give a lesson in meanness to a critter or a person, don't be suprised if they learn their lesson.

The best way to have a quiche for dinner is to make it up and put it in the oven to bake at 325 degrees.  Meanwhile, get out a large T-bone, grill it, and when it's done, eat it.  As for the quiche, continue to let it bake, but otherwise ignore it.

There's two theories to arguin' with a woman. Neither one works.

When you're throwin' your weight around, be ready to have it thrown around by somebody else.

Lettin' the cat outta the bag is a whole lot easier 'n puttin' it  back.

Always take a good look at what you're about to eat.  It's not so important to know what it is, but it's critical to know what it was.

The quickest way to double your money is to fold it over and put it back in your pocket.

A smart ass just don't fit in a saddle.

Never miss a good chance to shutup.

A preacher wanted to raise money for his church and on being told that there was a fortune in horse racing, decided to purchase one and enter it in the races.  However at the local auction, the going price for horses was so high that he ended up buying a donkey instead.  He figured that since he had it, he might as well go ahead and enter it in the races.  To his surprise, the donkey came in third! The next day the local paper carried this headline:

PREACHER'S ASS SHOWS

The preacher was so pleased with the donkey that he entered it in the race again, and this time it won. The paper read:

PREACHER'S ASS OUT IN FRONT

The Bishop was so upset with this kind of publicity that he ordered the preacher not to enter the donkey in another race. The paper headline read:

BISHOP SCRATCHES PREACHER'S ASS

This was too much for the Bishop, so he ordered the preacher to get rid of the donkey.  The preacher decided to give it to a nun in a nearby convent.  The paper headline the next day read:

NUN HAS BEST ASS IN TOWN

The Bishop fainted. He informed the nun that she would have to get rid of the donkey, so she sold it to a farmer for $10.00. Next day the headline read:

NUN SELLS ASS FOR $10.00

This was too much for the Bishop, so he ordered the nun to buy back the donkey, lead it to the plains where it could run wild and free. Next day, the headline in the paper read:

NUN ANNOUNCES HER ASS IS WILD AND FREE

The Bishop was buried the next day.

The new priest, at his first Mass, was so afraid that he was unable to speak. Before his second week at the pulpit, he asked the Monsignor how he could relax. The Monsignor said, "Put some martinis in the water pitcher. After a few sips, you should relax enough and everything should go smoothly." The next week the young priest put his elder's suggestion into practice and was really talking up a storm. After the sermon, he asked the Monsignor how he had done. The Monsignor replied, "A definite improvement over last week but I think there are a few things you should learn before you address the congregation again." 

FIRST: Next time, sip the martinis rather than gulping them down. 

SECOND: There are 10 commandments, not 12. 

THIRD: There are 12 disciples, not 10. 

FOURTH: David slew Goliath; he did not "kick the shit out of him." 

FIFTH: We do not refer to our Savior, Jesus Christ, and his disciples as "The late J.C. and the boys." 

SIXTH: Next Sunday there is a taffy pulling contest at St. Peter's not a peter pulling contest at St. Taffy's. 

SEVENTH: We don't refer to the Cross as the "Big T." 

EIGHTH: The Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost are not referred to as "Big Daddy, Junior, and the Spook." 

NINTH: The recommended grace before Meals AND Communion is NOT "RUB-A-DUB-DUB, THANX FOR THE GRUB, YEAH GOD!" 

TENTH: And last, but not least, it's the Virgin Mary, NOT "Mary with the Cherry!!!"

Sex Lives 

The minister was passing a group of young teens sitting on the Church lawn and stopped to ask what they were doing. 

"Nothing much Pastor." replied the one lad. "We just seeing who can tell the biggest lie about their sex life." 

"Boys ! Boys ! Boys !" he intoned. "I'm shocked. Why when I was your age, I never even thought about sex at all." 

They all replied, pretty much in unison, "You win Pastor!"

"Keeping One's Word"

There were two evil brothers.  They were rich, and used their money to keep their ways from the public eye.  They even attended the same church, and looked to be perfect Christians.

Then, their pastor retired, and a new one was hired.  Not only could he see right through the brothers' deception, but he also spoke well and true, and the church started to swell in numbers. A fund-raising campaign was started to build a new assembly.

All of a sudden, one of the brothers died.  The remaining brother sought out the new pastor the day before the funeral and handed him a check for the amount needed to finish paying for the new building. 

"I have only one condition," he said.  "At his funeral, you must say my brother was a saint."   The pastor gave his word, and deposited the check.

The next day, at the funeral, the pastor did not hold back. "He was an evil man," he said.  "He cheated on his wife and abused his family." After going on in this vein for a small time, he concluded with,

"But, compared to his brother, he was a saint."

HONK IF YOU LOVE JESUS

The other day I went to the local religious book store, where I saw a HONK IF YOU LOVE JESUS bumper sticker.  I bought it and put it on the back bumper of my car, and I'm really glad I did.  What an uplifting experience followed! I was stopped at the light at a busy intersection, just lost in thought about the Lord, and didn't notice that the light had changed. That bumper sticker really worked!  I found lots of people who love Jesus.

Why, the guy behind me started to honk like crazy.  He must REALLY love the Lord because pretty soon, he leaned out his window and yelled, "Jesus Christ!" as loud as he could.  It was like a football game with him shouting, "GO JESUS CHRIST, GO!" Everyone else started honking, too, so I leaned out my window and waved and smiled to all of those loving people.

There must have been a guy from Florida back there because I could hear him yelling something about a sunny beach, and saw him waving in a funny way with only his middle finger stuck up in the air.

I asked my two kids what that meant.  They kind of squirmed, looked at each other, giggled and told me that it was the Hawaiian good luck sign.  So, I leaned out the window and gave him the good luck sign back. Several cars behind, a very nice black man stepped out of his car and yelled something.  I couldn't hear him very well, but it sounded like, "Mother trucker," or "Mother's from there." Maybe he was from Florida, too.  He must really love the Lord.

A couple of the people were so caught up in the joy of the moment that they got out of their cars and were walking toward me.  I bet they wanted to pray, but just then I noticed that the light had changed to yellow, and stepped on the gas.

And a good thing I did, because I was the only driver to get across the intersection.  I looked back at them standing there.  I leaned way out the window, gave them a big smile and held up the Hawaiian good luck sign as I drove away.

Praise the Lord for such wonderful folks.

Two nuns are traveling through Transylvania in their car.  They get stopped at a traffic light. Suddenly, a diminutive vampire jumps onto the hood of the car and scratches at the windshield!

"Quick, quick!!" shouts the first nun, "What shall I do?"
 
"Turn the windshield wipers on, that will get rid of the abomination," shouts the second.  She switches them on, knocking the vampire about, but he clings on and hisses even more loudly!

"What'll I do now?", shouts the first nun.  "Switch on the windshield washer. I filled it up with Holy Water in the  Vatican!" says the second.  The vampire steams as the water burns his skin, but he clings on and hisses again at the nuns.

"Now what?" screams the first nun.

"Show him your cross!" says the second.

"Exactly," said Saint Peter."And when people rode in this man's taxi, they not only stayed awake, they even prayed."

A team of archaeologists was excavating in Israel when they came upon a cave.  Written on the wall of the cave were the following symbols in order of appearance.

1.  A dog
2.  A donkey
3.  A shovel
4.  A fish
5.  A Star of David

They decided that this was a unique find and the writings were at least more than three thousand years old.  They chopped out the piece of stone and had it brought to the museum where archaeologists from all  over the world came to study the ancient symbols. 

They held a huge meeting after months of conferences to discuss what they could agree was the meaning of the markings.  The President of their Society stood up, pointed at the first drawing and said,

"This looks like a dog.  We can judge that this was a highly intelligent race as they knew how to have animals for companionship. To prove this statement you, can see that the next symbol resembles a donkey, so, they were even smart enough to have animals help them till the soil.  The next drawing looks like a shovel of some sort, which means they even had tools to help them.  Even further proof of their high intelligence is the fish, which means that they had a famine that hit the earth whereby the food didn't grow, they would take to the sea for food.  The last symbol appears to be the Star of David which means they were evidently Hebrews." 

The audience applauded enthusiastically, the President smiled and said, "I'm glad to see that you are all in full agreement with our interpretations."

Suddenly a little old Jewish man stood up in the back of the room and said, "I object to every word. The explanation of what the writings say is quite simple. First of all, everyone knows that Hebrews don't read from  left to  right, but from right to left... Now, look again..... It  now says:

"HOLY MACKEREL, DIG THE ASS ON THAT BITCH!"

Jesus Visits Bar

An Australian, and Irishman and an Englishman were sitting in a bar. There was only one other person in the bar.  A man.  The three men kept looking at this other man, for he seemed terribly familiar.  They stared and stared, wondering where they had seen him before when suddenly the Irishman cried out, "My God!  I know who that man is - it's Jesus!"  The others looked again, and sure enough, it was Jesus himself, sitting alone at a table.  The Irishman calls out across the lounge, "Hey!  Hey you!  Are you Jesus?"  Jesus looks over at him, smiles a small smile and nods his head.

"Yes, I am Jesus" he says.

Well, the Irishman calls the bartender over and says to him "I'd like you to give Jesus over there a pint of Guiness from me."  The bartender pours Jesus a Guiness.  Jesus looks over, raises his glass in thanks and drinks.

The Englishman then calls out, "Er, excuse me Sir, but would you be Jesus?"

Jesus smiles and says 'Yes, I am Jesus".

The Englishman beckons the bartender and tells him to send over a pint of stout for Jesus, which the bartender duly does.  As before, Jesus accepts the drink and smiles over at the table.

Then the Australian calls out, "Oy you!  D'ya reckon you're Jesus or what?"

Jesus nods and says "Yes, I am Jesus".

The Australian is mighty impressed and has the bartender send over a pot of Fosters for Jesus which Jesus accepts with pleasure.

Finally, after finishing the drinks, Jesus leaves his seat and approaches our three friends.  He reaches for the hand of the Irishman and shakes it, thanking him for the Guiness.  When he lets go, the Irishman gives a cry of amazement "Oh God!  The arthritis is gone!  The arthritis I've had for years is gone! It's a miracle!!!"

Jesus then shakes the Englishman's hand, thanking him for the stout. Upon letting go, the Englishman's eyes widen in shock "By jove, the migraine!  the migraine I've for 40  years is completely gone - it's a miracle!!!"

Jesus then goes to approach the Australian who says "Back off mate! I'm on Worker's Comp." !!

Safe Boating Tips

When launching a boat, always back the boat into the water. Pulling the boat into the water can really mess up your carburetor.

When waterskiing, never allow a feisty duck to hitch a ride on your skis.

Always stay at least five boat-lengths behind the whale in front of you.

While sinking to the bottom of a lake or ocean, screaming does not help.

When boating, always wear a swimsuit with suspenders. This makes it easier on the guys with the grapling hook when they're trying to retrieve your body.

Drowning can cause severe shortness of breath. And you don't even want to think about what it does to your complexion.

Always wear a life jacket in case you fall overboard. Also, it's a good idea to take along something to read, in case you're swallowed by a whale. Most whales seem to enjoy Moby Dick.

Boating while intoxicated is not illegal in some states, but it's stupid in all of them.

The Irishman replies, "Well, you see, I have two brothers. One is in America, the other in Australia, and I'm here in Dublin.  When we all left home, we promised that we'd drink this way to remember the days when we drank together."

A fellow decides to take off early from work and go drinking. He stays until the bar closes at 2am, at which time he is extremely drunk. When he enters his house, he doesn't want to wake anyone, so he takes off his shoes and starts tip-toeing up the stairs. Half-way up the stairs, he falls over backwards and lands flat on his rear end.

That wouldn't have been so bad, except that he had couple of empty pint bottles in his back pockets, and they broke, and the broken glass carved up his buttocks terribly. But, he was so drunk that he didn't know he was hurt. A few minutes later, as he was undressing, he noticed blood, so he checked himself out in the mirror, and, sure enough, his behind was cut up something terrible. Well, he repaired the damage as best he could under the circumstances, and he went to bed.

The next morning, his head was hurting, and his rear was hurting, and he was hunkering under the covers trying to think up some good story, when his wife came into the bedroom.

"Well, you really tied one on last night," she said. Where'd you go?"

"I worked late," he said, "and I stopped off for a couple of beers."

Frank, an American visiting Texas, was invited to be one of the judges at a chili cook-off. He was assured by the other two judges that the chili wouldn't be all that spicy -- and besides -- they told him he could have free beer during the tasting. Here are the scorecards from the event:

Chili # 1: Mike's Maniac Mobster Monster Chili

JUDGE ONE: A little too heavy on tomato. Amusing kick.
JUDGE TWO: Nice, smooth tomato flavor Very mild.
FRANK: Holy smokes, what is this stuff? You could remove dried paint from your driveway with it. Took me two beers to put the flames out. Hope that's the worst one. These people are crazy.

Chili # 2: Arthur's Afterburner Chili

JUDGE ONE: Smoky (barbecue?) with a hint of pork. Slight Jalapeno tang.
JUDGE TWO: Exciting BBQ flavor, needs more peppers to be taken seriously.
FRANK: Keep this out of reach of children! I'm not sure what I am supposed to taste besides pain. I had to wave off two people who wanted to give me the Heimlich maneuver. Shoved my way to the front of the beer line. The barmaid looks like a professional wrestler after a bad night. She was so irritated over my gagging sounds that the snake tattoo under her eye started to twitch. She has arms like Popeye and a face like Winston Churchill. I will NOT pick a fight with her.

Chili # 3: Fred's Famous Burn Down the Barn Chili

JUDGE ONE: Excellent firehouse chili! Great kick. Needs more beans.
JUDGE TWO: A beanless chili, a bit salty, good use of red peppers.
FRANK: This has got to be a joke. Call the EPA, I've located a uranium spill. My nose feels like I have been sneezing Drano. Everyone knows the routine by now and got out of my way so I could make it to the beer wagon. Barmaid pounded me on the back; now my backbone is in the front part of my chest. She said her friends call her "Sally." Probably behind her back they call her "Forklift."

Chili # 4: Bubba's Black Magic

JUDGE ONE: Black bean chili with almost no spice. Disappointing.
JUDGE TWO: Hint of lime in the black beans. Good side dish for fish or other mild foods, not much of a chili.
FRANK: I felt something scraping across my tongue but was unable to taste it. Sally was standing behind me with fresh refills so I wouldn't have to dash over to see her. When she winked at me her snake sort of coiled and uncoiled ... it's kind of cute.

Chili # 5: Linda's Legal Lip Remover

JUDGE ONE: Meaty, strong chili. Cayenne peppers freshly ground adding considerable kick. Very impressive.
JUDGE TWO: Chili using shredded beef; could use more tomato. Must admit the cayenne peppers make a strong statement.
FRANK: My ears are ringing and I can no longer focus my eyes. I belched and four people in front of me needed paramedics. The contestant seemed hurt when I told her that her chili had given me brain damage. Sally saved my tongue by pouring beer directly on it from a pitcher. Sort of irritates me that one of the other judges asked me to stop screaming.

Chili # 6: Vera's Very Vegetarian Variety

JUDGE ONE: Thin yet b. Good balance of spice and peppers.
JUDGE TWO: The best yet. Aggressive use of peppers, onions, and garlic. Superb.
FRANK: My intestines are now a straight pipe filled with gaseous flames. No one wants to stand behind me except Sally. I asked if she wants to go dancing later.

Chili # 7: Susan's Screaming Sensation Chili

JUDGE ONE: A mediocre chili with too much reliance on canned peppers.
JUDGE TWO: Ho Hum, tastes as if the chef threw in canned chili peppers at the last moment.
FRANK: You could put a hand grenade in my mouth and pull the pin and I wouldn't feel it. I've lost the sight in one eye and the world sounds like it is made of rushing water. My clothes are covered with chili which slid unnoticed out of my mouth at some point. Good, at the autopsy they'll know what killed me. Go Sally, save yourself before it's too late. Tell our children I'm sorry I was not there to conceive them. I've decided to stop breathing, it's too painful and I'm not getting any oxygen anyway. If I need air I'll just let it in through the hole in my stomach. Call the X-Files people and tell them I've found a super nova on my tongue.

A woman is frustrated with her love life because her husband has a massive crush on Brigette Bardot and ignores her completely. To win back his attentions, she goes to a tattoo artist to have the letters 'BB' tattooed on her breasts.

The tattooist warns her that age and gravity would probably make this unattractive later in life, and suggests she have the tattoo on her butt instead. She agrees, and bends over to receive a "B" on each buttock. When her husband gets home from work that night, she greets him by turning around, bending over, and lifting her dress to expose the artwork. "What do you think?" the wife says.

"Uh, who the hell is Bob?" the husband replies.

An Italian, an Irishman and a Chinese fellow are hired at a construction site.  The foreman points out a huge pile of sand and says to the Italian guy, "Your're in charge of sweeping,"  to the Irishman, "You're in charge of shoveling, and to the Chinese guy, "And you're in charge of supplies. "Now, I have to leave for a little while.  I expect you guys to make a dent in that pile."

So the foreman goes away for a couple hours, and when he returns, the pile of sand is untouched. He says to the Italian, "Why didn't you sweep any of it?"  The Italian replies, "I didn't have a broom.  You said the Chinese guy was in charge of supplies, but he disappeared and I couldn't find him."

So then the foreman turn to the Irishman and asks why he didn't shovel.  The Irishman replies, "I couldn't get myself a shovel.  You left the Chinese guy in charge of supplies, but I couldn't find him."

The foreman is really ticked off now, and storms off toward the pile of sand looking for the Chinese guy.  Just then, the Chinese guy springs out from a closet and yells: "SUPPLIES!"

Farmer Brown, from Minnesota, had a bull that he was quite proud of. One day he looked at the bull and noticed his eyes were crossed. That was disconcerting, because he knew he couldn't get huge stud fees for a defective bull.  He called the local vet who came right over. The vet assured him he could solve the problem.

"Farmer Brown, you stand in front of the bull and watch his eyes. I will insert this straw into the bulls rectum and blow and when the eyes uncross, yell stop!!"  The vet did just that, and sure enough after a few minutes  of blowing, the eyes uncrossed.

Farmer Brown was thrilled.

Several months pass and again he sees the eyes cross.  He says to himself "I better call the vet. No, wait a moment... Last time I called the vet he charged me $250.00 for something that only took a few moments.  I will do it myself."

He went to the barn and called his trusty farm hand, Luke. "Luke, we have a problem here and this is what I want you to do. I will put this straw in the rear of my bull and blow.  You watch his eyes, and when they uncross, tell me and I will stop blowing."

Farmer Brown started blowing and blowing and nothing happened. Finally, he said  "You know, maybe I am not strong enough,  Luke. Lets trade positions and you blow and I will watch."

Luke went over to the bull, pulled out the straw, turned it around and reinserted it. "What the hell are you doing, Luke?" says Farmer Brown. "Hell, boss, whadda you think? I ain't blowing on the same end that you did!!!!"

An award should go to the United Airlines gate agent in Denver for being smart and funny, and making her point, when confronted with a passenger who probably deserved to fly as cargo.  Check this out . . .

A crowded United flight was canceled.  A single agent was rebooking a long line of inconvenienced travelers.  Suddenly an angry passenger pushed his way to the desk. He slapped his ticket down on the counter and said, "I HAVE to be on this flight and it has to be FIRST CLASS."

The agent replied, "I'm sorry sir. I'll be happy to try to help you, but I've got to help these folks first, and I'm sure we'll be able to work something out."

The passenger was unimpressed.  He asked loudly, so that the passengers behind him could hear, "Do you have any idea who I am?"

Without hesitating, the gate agent smiled and grabbed her public address microphone. "May I have your attention please?" she began, her voice bellowing throughout the terminal.  "We have a passenger here at the gate WHO DOES NOT KNOW WHO HE IS.  If anyone can help him find his identity, please come to the gate."

With the folks behind him in line laughing hysterically, the man glared at the United agent, gritted his teeth and swore, "F*** you."

Without flinching, she smiled and said, "I'm sorry, sir, but you'll have to stand in line for that, too."

One day this rich guy was having a party at his house. He was loaded, and he had everything; money, a big house in Beverly Hills, drugs, girls, cars, planes; anything he wanted. The guy was also a little eccentric, and he had filled his pool with crocodiles. So there he was,  him and his friends all standing around drinking, getting high and partying next to the pool.
The guy gets up on the life gard tower and all his friends look up. He calls for silence and says "OK, the first person the swims across my pool will get all my money."
No one moves. The guy looks over the crowd, draws on his joint and says "OK, the first person that swims across my pool gets all my money and my house."
Still no one moves. "OK then, the first person the swims across my pool gets all my money, my house and all my cars and planes."
Still, no one moves, not even a eye blinks this time. 
"OK then, all my money, my house, all my cars, all my planes, all the dope you can handle, all my property, all my stocks and bonds and investments and all the girls you can handle; everything I own."
"Splash!" Someone's in the pool. Crocodiles are all over him, but he rolls over like Tarzan, he's all over the place, fighting and dodging.  Finally he gets out of the pool on the other side. The rich guy on tower jumps down and runs over to him.
"That was incredible! I never thought that I would ever see that done. Do you want the money now or later?"
"I don't want the money."
"Do you want the house now or later?"
"I don't want the house."

Two Arabs boarded a shuttle out of Washington for New York.  One sat in the window seat, the other in the middle seat.  Just before takeoff an Israeli guy got on and took the aisle seat next to the Arabs.  He kicked off his shoes, wiggled his toes and was settling in when the Arab in  the window seat said, "I think I'll go up and get a Coke."
"No problem," said the Jew.  "I'll get it for you."
While he was gone the Arab picked up the Israeli's shoe and spit init. When the Jew returned with the Coke, the other Arab said, "That looks good.  Think I'll have one too." Again, the Israeli obligingly went to fetch it, and while he was gone the Arab picked up the other shoe and spit in it. The Israeli returned with the Coke, and they all sat back and enjoyed the short flight.  As the plane was landing the Israeli slipped his feet into his shoes and knew immediately what had happened.
"How long must this go on?" he asked, shaking his head sadly.  "This enmity between our peoples ..... this arguing, this hatred, this spitting in shoes and peeing in Cokes?"

The average cost of rehabilitating a seal after the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska was $80,000. At a special ceremony, two of the animals, whose rescue was the most expensive, were released back into the wild amid cheers and applause from onlookers. A minute later they were both eaten by a killer whale.

In 1992,a Los Angeles resident made an attempt on the world flagpole-sitting record. By the time he had come down, eight hours short of the 400-day record, his sponsor had gone bust, his girlfriend had left him and his phone and electricity had been cut off.

A woman came home to find her husband in the kitchen, shaking frantically with what looked like a wire running from his waist to the electric kettle. Intending to jolt him away from the deadly current, she whacked him with a plank of wood she found by the back door and broke his arm in two places. A shame, as he had merely been listening to his Walkman.

Two animal rights activists were protesting the cruelty of sending pigs to a slaughterhouse in Germany. Suddenly the pigs, all two thousand of them, escaped through a broken fence and stampeded, trampling the two hapless protesters to death.
